Main page, possibly with an about section in a jumbotron, links to two different sub pages: quantum chemistry and web development. The main github repository should also be linked.
The main page and sub pages should be rendered in AJAX. Mention whole site is built from scratch, with no template. Use a stock background image for the 'about me' jumbotron. Get a favicon.
Add meta tags for relevant areas. Make sure navigation tools are implemented. Add a home page navigation option on subpages. Add page titales for each individual page.
Make sure all pages are responsive for different page sizes. add hover states to show clickability. Decalre character coding. Remove reset.css calls from all html files and delete all reset. css files.
Add alt tags for all images describing what the image is. Maybe use handlebars for the text on projects page. Check relative path names, should be able to user example.css instead of /subpage/.../example.css
add a home page navigation button for all pages, as well as a 'return to web dev or quant chem' for the relevant pages.Check image resolutions on main page to not be too big to load well.

Quantum chemistry covers basic quantum chemical descriptions, HF, MP2, CCSD and MCSCF etc., as well as thesis and what that means, as well as link to thesis.

Web development describes types of code and tools that have been covered, HTML, CSS, JS, Java, angular, react, bootstrap etc., 
and links to seperate pages for each codecademy project, with sub headings for each area. The code for each project should be linked to via github,
extra navigation tools for each language and tool would help a lot, too. If too much is text is needed for a desciption, ass an overflow: scroll to the paragraph elements.
Add a scrolling header that has a function to return to the previous page.
